# FxmeNet todo

Numbered items keep their number when they move to `done.md`. Phases refer to
[`../plan.md`](../plan.md) section 5.

## Phase 0: spikes

2. Spike 2, remaining: the side channel works on Linux (Phase 1); run the
   loopback harness on Windows and macOS (the `INetPlugin` layout and
   `__stdcall` convention are the part to confirm there).
3. Spike 3: a minimal JUCE plugin hosting a VST3 and embedding its editor,
   in Reaper on Linux (nested XEmbed).
4. Read AudioGridder (MIT): jitter buffer, PDC, offline render, parameter
   mapping, sandboxing. Note what to reuse.
12. Not FxmeNet's code, to report to AmbiRR2: when `isNonRealtime()`, wait for
    the image-source recompute instead of processing with stale taps, so
    offline bounces are deterministic.

## Phase 1 onwards

6. Phase 2: protocol (with transport, MIDI, latency changes, channel masks),
   `fxmenet-server`, command-line test client.
7. Phase 3: FxmeNetPlugin tier 0, parameter pool with learn mapping, channel
   enable/disable UI.
8. Phase 4: shadow editors and telemetry; port Compressor and Equalizer.
9. Phase 5: hardening, measurements, CI.
10. Phase 6: plugin distribution.
11. Phase 7: JSFX.
